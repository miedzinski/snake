# Algorithms

## Random

Issues random move every tick.

## Pathfinder

Searches for shortest path from head to food and follows if it's
possible to reach snake's tail after eating, otherwise follows tail.
If there is no path from head to tail snake moves randomly.

## Monte Carlo

A variant of MCTS called Pure Monte Carlo tree search, in which selection step
and all further moves in simulation are chosen randomly.
